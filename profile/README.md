## Welcome to Blue Space Team

We were established on April 14, 2022.

The name comes from the famous science fiction novel ***The Three-Body Problem*** by Liu Cixin. The Blue Space in the book is a stellar-class warship left by mankind. In the end, it flew into the depths of space, entered the four-dimensional space, and continued the human civilization on Earth.
